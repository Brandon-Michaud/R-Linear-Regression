# R-Linear-Regression
This analysis was done as my final project for my Applied Statistical Methods course. To view the analysis, download and open the HTML file. I have also included the Rmd file that produced the HTML as well as the data set, just for reference. The write-up includes a heavy dose of discussion of relevance of the data and the theory behind simple linear regression. While these are both important, the real meat-and-bones of the project can be found beginning at section 3, SLR Estimation of the Parameters, in the HTML file.
