# Overview
This analysis was done as my final project for my Applied Statistical Methods course. To view the analysis, download and open the .html file. I have also included the .Rmd file that produced the HTML as well as the data set, just for reference. The write-up includes a heavy dose of discussion of relevance of the data and the theory behind simple linear regression. While these are both important, the real meat-and-bones of the project can be found beginning at section 3, SLR Estimation of the Parameters, in the .html file.

# Relevant Topics and Skills
- R programming
- Simple Linear Regression (SLR) theory
- Point estimation using SLR
- Interval estimation using SLR
- Checking assumptions of SLR
- Quadratic modeling
- Measuring fit of models
